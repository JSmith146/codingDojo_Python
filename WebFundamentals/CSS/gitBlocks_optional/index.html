                <h3>What is Git?</h3>
                <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots
                    (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapshot you build out
                    a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app.
                    During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a
                    previous snapshots you took or merge those experiments into your app.
                </p>
                <h3>What is GitHub?</h3>
                <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and other work
                    together on projects from anywhere
                    using those code snapshots that you took during development.
                </p>

                        <h4>Git init</h4>
                        <p><span>Git init</span> is the act of registering this current code base.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="block block-3">
                        <h4>Git add</h4>
                        <p><span>Git add</span> is how we stage the intergration of our current code base into
                            our current list of snapshots</p>

                        <p><span>Git status</span> allows us to see the changes we are going to make</p>

                        <h4>Git commit</h4>
                        <p><span>Git commit</span>; finally we can commit those changes we added to our last snapshot
                            giving us a new snapshot of our code with whatever new changes were made</p>

                        <p><span>Git remote add</span> is used to set up a online repository where we can place all of
                            our
                            current code. This is where the outside world can see our code base.</p>

                        <p><span>Git push</span> is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to store all of
                            our
                            repositories. Other developers might look at our existing projects to see how we approached
                            problems,
                            pull down our code and add new featuers or even update our code base with features they
                            wanted to add</p>
